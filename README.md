# 20th_Challenge

## Summary of Purpose  
---

I created a smart contract that functions as a joint savings account that stores Ethereum.

I coded the contract with the Solidity programming language inside of the Remix IDE (Integrated Developement Environment, basically a fancy code-editor). Remix allowed me to deploy the contract on a local chain (making it free to test my contract).

If you just want to see sample usuage, look at the screenshots in the Execution_Results folder.

## Required/Compatible Technologies
---
If you want to actually run the code, continue reading this section.

**Compatible OS's:**   
    Mac, Windows, or Linux    
**Programming language:**   
    Solidity v0.5.0 (filetype: .sol)  
**Required libraries/installations:**    
    None

---
## How to Just View the Code
---
You can view it on this github repository.  
You can also use a code editor that supports Solidity (.sol files), e.g. VSCode or Remix.

---
## How to Actually Open/Use the Contract on a Local Chain
---

Download this github repo.  

Go to remix.ethereum.org  

Upload the joint_savings.sol file.  
Double click it in the file-tree to open it.  
Click the compile icon on the left side of the screen. Switch the compiler to v0.5.0 .  
Click the compile button.  
Click the deploy icon on the left side of the screen.  
Make sure the "Environment" is set to "Remix VM (London)".  
Make sure the selected contract is "JointSavings".  
Hit deploy.  
Hit the expand arrow under the "Deployed Contracts" section.  
You can play with the functions there to test the contract.  
You can also change the address calling the contract near the top of the deploy panel.  
Using the London environment ensures you won't be charged anything by deploying/calling the contract.

### Note on This Repo's Title  
---
Here's why this repo is considered my 20th_Challenge:

There was no 8th or 9th challenge because my 1st group project took place of those 2 challenges.   
Similarly, my 2nd group project took place of 2 more challenges (challenges 16 & 17).  
So this repo is technically my 16th challenge because 20 - (2+2) = 16.  
I just called it "20th_Challenge" for convenience, based on the structure of the coding cource I took.
